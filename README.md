# Contests Reminder

A flutter app that shows upcoming contests on AtCoder and Codeforces, can notify about upcoming contests 1 hour, 30, 10, 15, 10, 5 minutes or 1 minute before they begin, and notifies when new contests are listed.
Atm android only, could be iOS too if enough requests are made.

# To-do:
 * Add firebase storage instead database (this as reference: https://fireship.io/lessons/flutter-push-notifications-fcm-guide/)
 * Implement some pattern like BLOC, scope_model or RxDart, take out the contestsList as a widget and make it reactive in order to use it on both contestsList and hiddenContests, also could be with https://github.com/appdev/FlutterRxBus or https://pub.dev/packages/event_bus

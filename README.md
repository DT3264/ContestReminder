# Contests Reminder

A flutter app that shows upcoming contests on AtCoder and Codeforces, can remind about upcoming contests 1 hour, 30, 10, 15, 10, 5 minutes or 1 minute prior for they to begin, and notifies when new contests are listed.
At the moment android only, could be iOS too if enough requests are made.
